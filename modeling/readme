- model.mod			[Model and data (example) used in the MILP formulation in the paper]
- input.dat			[Input data (example) to run the model] 
- model.run			[Commands to run the model]

The formulation is in 'model.mod' file.
Example data for the model is in 'input.dat' file. 
The execution commands are in 'model.run' file.

Decision variables: 
x[]: feasibility of transferring ith timestep (x[i] = 1 is ith analysis may be transferred for in situ visualization, 0 if not)
total_imp: Total importance of all the time steps that were recommended for in situ visualization

We used the AMPL (Version 20211221) [1] modeling language for our formulations and the BARON solver which implements branch and reduce method to solve non-linearly constrained optimization problems. Any other solver for MILP can be used, as listed in [2]. Note that different solvers have different algorithms and hence varying solve times.
